# A 63-dimensional counterexample to Borsuk's conjecture

This repository contains:

- [borsuk_63_counterexample.pdf](borsuk_63_counterexample.pdf): proof of \(d_B\le 63\);
- [verify_borsuk63.py](verify_borsuk63.py): exact finite verification used in the proof;
- [certificates/](certificates): DIMACS graph certificates and SHA256 metadata;
- [verify_borsuk63_sage.sage](verify_borsuk63_sage.sage): independent Sage verification of the exported DIMACS certificates.

Here \(d_B\) denotes the least dimension in which Borsuk's conjecture fails. The previous best published upper bound was \(d_B\le 64\), due to Jenrich and Brouwer, building on Bondarenko's \(G_2(4)\) construction.

The verification script reconstructs the \(G_2(4)\) finite model over \(\mathbb F_{16}\) and checks:

- the strongly regular parameters \((416,100,36,20)\);
- the partition \(V=B\sqcup C\), with \(|B|=96\) and \(|C|=320\);
- the three \(32\)-vertex components \(B_1,B_2,B_3\) of the induced graph on \(B\);
- the degree data between \(B_1,B_2,B_3\) and \(C\) used for the dimension drop;
- the clique obstructions used to show that every smaller-diameter subset has size at most \(5\).

Run:

```bash
python verify_borsuk63.py
```

To regenerate the DIMACS certificates, run:

```bash
python export_borsuk63_certificates.py
```

If Sage is available, the exported DIMACS certificates can be checked independently with:

```bash
sage verify_borsuk63_sage.sage
```

The GitHub Actions workflow runs the pure-Python verification and checks that
the exported certificates are reproducible. The Sage verifier is provided as
an optional independent check.

The construction and proof were obtained with assistance from GPT-5.5 Pro.
