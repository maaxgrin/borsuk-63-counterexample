Borsuk_63_note

This repository contains a proof note and an exact finite verification script for a 63-dimensional construction related to Borsuk's conjecture. It gives

$$
C_{28}\le 63,
$$

where \(C_{28}\) denotes the least dimension in which Borsuk's conjecture fails.

The construction starts from the \(G_2(4)\) strongly regular graph described by Brouwer [[BroG24](#BroG24)] and used in Bondarenko's 65-dimensional two-distance counterexample [[Bon2014](#Bon2014)]. The previous best bound \(C_{28}\le64\) is due to Jenrich and Brouwer [[JB2014](#JB2014)].

The principle of the proof is as follows. In the standard \(65\)-dimensional representation of \(G_2(4)\), an isotropic point \(q_0\) defines a partition \(B_1,B_2,B_3,C\) of the vertices. The \(320\) points indexed by \(C\) are orthogonal to a 2-dimensional space spanned by three block sums, hence lie in a 63-dimensional subspace. One then adds a single projected point \(p\) in the same subspace, chosen so that the diameter remains the original large distance. The absence of a \(6\)-clique in \(G_2(4)\) then implies that every smaller-diameter part has at most \(5\) points, so \(321\) points require at least \(65>64\) parts.

1. Quoted input.

This part records the standard graph-theoretic and Euclidean facts used as input.

Let

$$
\Gamma\simeq \mathrm{srg}(416,100,36,20)
$$

be the \(G_2(4)\) graph. We use its standard Euclidean representation [[Bon2014](#Bon2014), [BroG24](#BroG24)], namely vectors

$$
x_v\in\mathbb R^{65}\qquad (v\in V(\Gamma))
$$

such that

$$
x_u\cdot x_v=
\begin{cases}
90, & u=v,\\
18, & u\sim v,\\
-6, & u\not\sim v.
\end{cases}
$$

Equivalently, the Gram matrix is

$$
G=96I+24A-6J,
$$

where \(A\) is the adjacency matrix of \(\Gamma\). The eigenvalues of \(G_2(4)\), as recorded by Brouwer [[BroG24](#BroG24)], give that \(G\) is positive semidefinite of rank \(65\). In this representation,

$$
\|x_u-x_v\|^2=
\begin{cases}
144, & u\sim v,\\
192, & u\not\sim v.
\end{cases}
$$

We also use the clique obstruction underlying Bondarenko's construction [[Bon2014](#Bon2014)]:

$$
\omega(\Gamma)=5.
$$

The script `verify_borsuk63.py` reconstructs the graph and verifies this obstruction again.

2. The finite partition.

This part defines the partition, from an isotropic point \(q_0\), whose verified degree data will be used for the dimension drop.

Fix an isotropic point \(q_0\) in the projective model of \(G_2(4)\) described by Brouwer [[BroG24](#BroG24)]. Let \(B\) be the set of vertices containing a non-isotropic point orthogonal to \(q_0\), and put

$$
C=V(\Gamma)\setminus B.
$$

The exact verification gives

$$
|B|=96,\qquad |C|=320.
$$

It also gives that the induced graph on \(B\) has three connected components

$$
B_1,B_2,B_3
$$

of size \(32\), and verifies

$$
\begin{aligned}
&|N(u)\cap B_i|=20 &&(u\in B_i),\\
&|N(u)\cap B_j|=0 &&(u\in B_i,\ i\ne j),\\
&|N(u)\cap C|=80 &&(u\in B),\\
&|N(c)\cap B_i|=8 &&(c\in C,\ i=1,2,3),\\
&|N(c)\cap C|=76 &&(c\in C).
\end{aligned}
$$

3. Dimension reduction.

This part shows that the \(320\) points indexed by \(C\) lie in a codimension-\(2\) subspace of the standard \(\mathbb R^{65}\) representation.

For \(i=1,2,3\), set

$$
S_i=\sum_{y\in B_i}x_y.
$$

If \(c\in C\), then \(c\) has \(8\) neighbors and \(24\) non-neighbors in \(B_i\). Hence

$$
x_c\cdot S_i
=8\cdot18+24\cdot(-6)
=0.
$$

Thus every \(x_c\), \(c\in C\), is orthogonal to \(S_1,S_2,S_3\).

The same degree data give

$$
S_i\cdot S_i
=32(90+20\cdot18+11\cdot(-6))
=12288,
$$

and, for \(i\ne j\),

$$
S_i\cdot S_j
=32^2(-6)
=-6144.
$$

The Gram matrix of \(S_1,S_2,S_3\) has diagonal entries \(12288\) and off-diagonal entries \(-6144\), hence has rank \(2\). Since the ambient representation has rank \(65\), the orthogonal complement

$$
\mathrm{span}(S_1,S_2,S_3)^\perp
$$

has dimension \(63\), and all points \(x_c\), \(c\in C\), lie in this subspace.

4. The added point.

This part constructs one further point in the same 63-dimensional subspace and records its products with the points indexed by \(C\).

Choose \(b\in B_1\), and define

$$
z_b=x_b-\frac1{32}S_1.
$$

The verified degree data imply

$$
z_b\cdot S_i=0\qquad (i=1,2,3),
$$

so \(z_b\) lies in the same 63-dimensional subspace. Moreover

$$
\|z_b\|^2
=90-\frac{2}{32}\cdot384+\frac{1}{32^2}\cdot12288
=78.
$$

For \(c\in C\), since \(S_1\cdot x_c=0\),

$$
z_b\cdot x_c=x_b\cdot x_c
=
\begin{cases}
18, & b\sim c,\\
-6, & b\not\sim c.
\end{cases}
$$

Let

$$
t=\frac{\sqrt{222}-1}{13},
\qquad
p=tz_b.
$$

Then

$$
78t^2+12t=102.
$$

Set

$$
X=\{x_c:c\in C\}\cup\{p\}.
$$

Then \(X\subset\mathbb R^{63}\) and \(|X|=321\).

5. Diameter and clique obstruction.

This part computes the diameter of the resulting \(321\)-point set and uses the clique obstruction to bound smaller-diameter subsets.

For \(c,c'\in C\), the quoted two-distance representation gives

$$
\|x_c-x_{c'}\|^2=
\begin{cases}
144, & c\sim c',\\
192, & c\not\sim c'.
\end{cases}
$$

For the added point \(p\),

$$
\|p-x_c\|^2=
\begin{cases}
192-48t, & b\sim c,\\
192, & b\not\sim c.
\end{cases}
$$

Therefore

$$
\mathrm{diam}(X)^2=192.
$$

Let \(Y\subset X\) have diameter strictly smaller than \(\mathrm{diam}(X)\). If \(p\notin Y\), then the corresponding vertices in \(C\) must be pairwise adjacent, hence form a clique in \(\Gamma\). Since \(\Gamma\) has no \(6\)-clique, \(|Y|\le5\).

If \(p\in Y\), then every other point of \(Y\) must be some \(x_c\) with \(b\sim c\), and these \(c\)'s must be pairwise adjacent. Hence

$$
\{b\}\cup\{c\in C:x_c\in Y\setminus\{p\}\}
$$

is a clique in \(\Gamma\). Again using the absence of a \(6\)-clique, this gives \(|Y|\le5\).

Thus every subset of \(X\) of strictly smaller diameter has at most \(5\) points. Any partition of \(X\) into subsets of strictly smaller diameter therefore needs at least

$$
\left\lceil\frac{321}{5}\right\rceil=65
$$

parts. Since \(65>64=63+1\), this gives a counterexample to Borsuk's conjecture in \(\mathbb R^{63}\). Consequently,

$$
C_{28}\le63.
$$

6. Verification.
